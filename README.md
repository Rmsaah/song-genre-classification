# song-genre-classification
The goal is to classify a songâ€™s genre using its lyrics. By applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, it predicts whether a given lyric belongs to genres such as pop, rock, rap, or others in the dataset. In addition, a Streamlit web-app is available so anyone can test their own lyrics and get immediate predictions.
